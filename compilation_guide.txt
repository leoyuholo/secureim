This is the compilation guide for running the server of SecureIM.

1.	Install Java (JDK):

	If you do not have JDK installed, you can install it by following the instructions:
	
	apt-get install python-software-properties
	add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/java
	apt-get update
	apt-get install sun-java6-jdk sun-java6-jre
	
2. Install MySQL:

	If you do not have MySQL installed, you may install xampp by following the instructions:
	
	get latest version from xampp: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html
	follow the instruction on the page to install and start xampp
	
3.	Import sample database tables to MySQL

	I use phpMyAdmin to manage MySQL, you can do the same way
	
	get into phpmyadmin page
	import "CSCI3310.sql"
	
4.	Modify constant variables in MessageServer.java
	
	some variables are configured for running my own MySQL
	change it to your configuration by 
	modifying variables "url", "user" and "password" in line 17, 18, 19 of the source code
	
5.	Modify run.sh

	change the variable "DIR" in the script to the directory you extracted the files
	run run.sh by input command "./run.sh" to run message server
	
6.	Modify the ip address of message server on client side
	
	open the Android project of SecureIM
	open the file MessageClient.java in SecureIM/src/com/example/secureim/
	modify variable "defaultHost" to the ip of your message server
	build the app and run on emulator or any Android devices
	
7.	Done!
